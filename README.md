# Simple Flask Portfolio

This straightforward Flask web application serves as a basic portfolio with a contact form. Users can view the main page displaying portfolio information and navigate to a contact form to leave messages.

## Features:

- **Portfolio Display:**
  - Information about the owner's skills, projects, or any relevant details.

- **Contact Form:**
  - Users can submit messages via a contact form.
  - Collected data is stored in both a text file (`database.txt`) and a CSV file (`database.csv`).

## Usage:

1. Run the application using `server.py`.
2. Explore the portfolio on the main page (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3. Use the contact form to submit messages.
4. Submitted information is saved to both `database.txt` and `database.csv`.

Feel free to personalize the portfolio content and enhance the application to include additional sections or features. Remember to adapt the code and structure based on your specific portfolio requirements.
